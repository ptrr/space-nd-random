So, here we are. We're in the day and age of agile development and generic systems. We try to build something as generic as possible so we can deploy it for multiple systems and multiple users. We aim to make things as easy as possible for clients at the cost of certain exceptions and functionalities. 

This is something I constantly encounter in my daily work. I like building something and after that reusing it again. I like to build a product with a beginning and an end. But this is usually not possible due to my own perfectionism or the constant changing of requirements. 

I hear sighing whenever certain things we build don't exactly add up to the clients wishes.
